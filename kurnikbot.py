## This is a chess playing bot for kurnik site
## It uses pystockfish module to handle communication with
## powerful open-source Stockfish engine
## Requires following additional Python modules (can be installed via pip):
## - pyperclip (for clipboard handling)
## - pgn (for pgn parsing)
## - chess (for game state representation)
## - pymouse (for mouse events)
## - pykeyboard (for keyboard events)
## You need stockfish accessible via 'stockfish' from shell:
